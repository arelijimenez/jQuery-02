				<h5>Software Maintenance –What Is It?</h5>
					<p>
					If you intend to implement a custom software in your business, you should accept the fact that just to launch and use it
					for decades without any maintenance is impossible. First, because of the constantly changing environment you have to
					adapt to and therefore introduce some changes in the existing software. Second, it’s impossible to fully assess the level of
					adapt to and therefore introduce some changes in the existing software. Second, it’s impossible to fully assess the level of
					improvement, optimization, defects resolution of a software after its launch. 
				  </p>
			</div>
			<div id="types" class="scrollto" tabindex="-1">
				<h5>Software Maintenance Types to Distinguish</h5>
				<p>
					Software maintenance can be performed in a number of ways, and each of them has its own specifics. At this moment
					there are four software maintenance types which are aimed at different aspects, you can find them below:
					Adaptive
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Adaptive</li>
					<p>
						This maintenance category presupposes implementation of amendments in compliance with the dynamically changing
						environment, both business and technical, and focuses on the infrastructure of a software. Adaptive maintenance
						doesn’t affect the behaviour of the software, so users may even not notice that something has been changed.
					</p>
					<li>Perfective</li>
					<p>
						This type of maintenance involves fixing bugs and issues detected in the software, improvement of its functionality by
						new features implementation or eliminating the unnecessary and obsolete ones.
					</p>
					<li>Preventive</li>
					<p>
						Preventive maintenance is aimed at prevention of any vulnerabilities in the future. This type presupposes making
						improvements to a product to prevent any significant alterations that may entail rework and therefore additional
						expenses.
					<li>Reasons Why Software Maintenance Is Now a Must</li>
					<p>
						You couldn’t agree more that technologies have reached the unprecedentedly high level, and the expectations from any
						software are appropriate. 
					</p>
			  	</ul>
				  <div id="path" class="scrollto" tabindex="-1">
				<h5>Path of Software Maintenance</h5>
					<p>
						Software development itself is a complex process requiring a plethora of actions performed by various team members.
						Communication with a customer, code writing, testing procedures, changes implementation in case of their necessity…
						But what happens when all stages are completed, issues solved and the project is developed and successfully launched?
						Work doesn’t stop when the development process comes to an end, there comes time for software maintenance.And this 
						phase is no less important than the development process.
